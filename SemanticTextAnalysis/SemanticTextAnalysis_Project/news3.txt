At least 38 people are reported to have been killed in an air strike on a wedding party in south-western Yemen.
Medics said women and children were among those who died in Wahijah, a village near the Red Sea port of Mocha.
The Saudi-led coalition, which began an air campaign in March to defeat the Houthi rebel movement, denied it was responsible for the attack.
However, witnesses said warplanes targeted the celebration and Yemeni officials acknowledged a mistake.
The UN says almost 4,900 people have been killed in the past six month, including 2,200 civilians.
False news
A resident of Wahijah told the Reuters news agency that two tents where a wedding for a local man affiliated with the Houthis was being celebrated were targeted in the air strike.
Many of the victims were women and children, the resident added.
Yemeni security sources told the Associated Press that the coalition had targeted the wedding, and the agency quoted a senior government official as saying the strike was a mistake.
